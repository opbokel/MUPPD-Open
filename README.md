A open source game named Mega Ultra Ping Pong Deluxe.
It was removed from the play store due to Atari making a claim of copyright infringement.
I do not agree, it is based in Pong, but is too original to be considered a clone, I see as a tribute. I decided that the most important thing was the game so I removed all the ads and made the code open source.

The last APK is always in the root folder.

The game has it own engine, a partially implemented multiplayer blue-tooth function (not working yet) and is designed to be very easy to create a modifier(power up).

I hope that the community continue this project and make more modifiers, power ups are called modifiers since they modify the game play.

I believe it a good example to show the basics of developing a game engine and I would be glad if this game is used for educational proposes.

Any questions mail me to mindthegapgames@gmail.com

I will make a better documentation o the future

Watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9i5dcZTOk keep in mind that is a old version.
The current version has more modifiers and they have icons.
