A open source game named Mega Ultra Ping Pong Deluxe.
It was removed from the play store due to Atari making a claim of copyright infringement.

I do not agree, it is based in Pong, but is too original to be considered a clone. It is, at most, a tribute.
I decided that the most important thing was the game so I removed all the ads and made the code open source.

The last APK is always in the root folder.

The game has it own engine, a partially implemented multiplayer bluetooth function and is designed to be very easy to create a modifier(power up). Each modifier changes completely the game play.

I hope that the community continue this project and make more modifiers, power ups are called modifiers since they modify the game play.

I believe it is a good example how to develop a basic game engine and I would be glad if people use this game for educational proposes.

Any questions mail me to mindthegapgames@gmail.com

I will make a better documentation in the future.

Watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9i5dcZTOk keep in mind that is a old version.
The current version has more modifiers and they have icons.
